This app is an example to show what happens when JS is exported with webpack while JS is present in the assets/vendor/js directory.

Supporting information is accessible in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/yellow5/a8ca58a416f55e9279a7b5aed7c0e8e7).

# PhxWebpackExample

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
